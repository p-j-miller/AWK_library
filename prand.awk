function prand() # Based on the portable random number generator from Numerical recipes 1st edition.  
		# Its advantage is that it should give identical results with all awk interpreters
		# Constants from table 3 in "TABLES OF LINEAR CONGRUENTIAL GENERATORS OF DIFFERENT SIZES AND GOOD LATTICE STRUCTURE" by PIERRE Lâ€™ECUYER, Jan 1999
		# Do not use this for any cryptographic applications, but its period of 34,359,738,337 should be adaquate for many applications.
		# It was developed to generate test cases for various algorithms (like sort, median).
		# it generates a uniformly distributed random number between 0 and 1. 0 and 1 will never be generated.
		# Note Cliff random number generator is sometimes suggested for this type of application - but the author found this did not generate uniformly distributed random number between 0 and 1 
		# (it does does generate numbers between 0 and 1 but they are not uniformly distributed so for example do not give an average of 0.5 when a large number of values are generated).
		# Taking the average of a large number of values returned by prand() will give a number very close to 0.5
{if(rand_value<=0) rand_value=2147483647 # 2^31-1 is used as a seed - it could be any value >0. rand_value is a global variable, thats automatically created when required.
 rand_value=int((rand_value*185852) %34359738337 ) # rand_value*(m-1)<2^53 so will fit exactly in an ieee double 
 return rand_value/34359738337  # returns a number >0..<1
